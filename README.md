# MetaHipMer2 - MHM2 #

[MetaHipMer (*MHM*)](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome/downloads?authuser=0) is a *de novo* metagenome short-read assembler. This is version 2 (MHM2), which is written entirely in
[UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov) and runs efficiently on both single servers and on multinode supercomputers, where it can scale up to
coassemble terabase-sized metagenomes. More information about MetaHipMer can be found under the [ExaBiome Project](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome) 
of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org) and in several publications:
